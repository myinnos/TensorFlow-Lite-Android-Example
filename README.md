# TensorFlow Lite Android Example
An example Android application using TensorFLow Lite. The demo is a sample camera app that classifies images continuously using either a quantized Mobilenet model or a floating point Inception-v3 model. To run the demo, a device running Android 5.0 ( API 21) or higher is required.

In the demo app, inference is done using the TensorFlow Lite Java API. The demo app classifies frames in real-time, displaying the top most probable classifications. It also displays the time taken to detect the object.
